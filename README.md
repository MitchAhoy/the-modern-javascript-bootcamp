### the-modern-javascript-bootcamp
I completed this course over the course of 2.5 months where I learned the fundimentals of javascript.

I don't have all of the project files as I was no great at organising code when I first started so most of it is lost. I started learning and using GitHub while I was already through a large chunk of the course.

All future courses will have code uploaded to track progress
